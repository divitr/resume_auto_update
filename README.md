# Resume Auto Update Script

main logic implemented in python, written to LATEX file (template: Jake's Resume (https://www.overleaf.com/project/64e1c3ebe5f52debb8b9ab95))

bash script checks for updates, if json is updated, rewrites and compiles all versions

later:
 - implement automatic run on login (currently running with bash command in a terminal window (perpetually kept open))
 - add more resume categories
 - relative file structure (currently explicitly defined)

note that to use the bash script, give it executable permissions (chmod -x <path>)
